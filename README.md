12. Implement Linear Regression problem. For example, based on a dataset comprising of 
existing set of prices and area/size of the houses, predict the estimated price of a given house.
13. Based on multiple features/variables perform Linear Regression. For example, based on a
number of additional features like number of bedrooms, servant room, number of balconies,
number of houses of years a house has been built predict the price of a house.
14. Implement a classification/ logistic regression problem. For example based on different 
features of students data, classify, whether a student is suitable for a particular activity. Based on 
the available dataset, a student can also implement another classification problem like checking
whether an email is spam or not.
15. Use some function for regularization of dataset based on problem 14.
16. Use some function for neural networks, like Stochastic Gradient Descent or backpropagation 
- algorithm to predict the value of a variable based on the dataset of problem 14.
